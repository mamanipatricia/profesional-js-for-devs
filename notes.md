What is JavaScript?
==================

the language is far from hermetic. It swims in a veritable ocean of adjacent specifications that govern APIs form everything that JS touches: 
- the DOM
- network requests
- system hardware
- storage
- events
- files
- cryptography
- and hundred of others

JS is more accurately characterized as a constellation of browser implementations.

JS -> first appear in 1995

**JS is at once a very simple and very complicated language that takes minutes to learn but years to master.**

Though JavaScript and ECMAScript are often used synonymously, JavaScript is much more than just what is defined in ECMA-262. Indeed, a complete JavaScript implementation is made up of the following three distinct parts (see Figure 1-1):

➤➤ The Core (ECMAScript)
➤➤ The Document Object Model (DOM)
➤➤ The Browser Object Model (BOM)

Web browsers are just one host environment in which
an ECMAScript implementation may exist

#### The Document Object Model
(DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for XML that
was extended for use in HTML. The DOM maps out an entire page as a hierarchy of nodes. Each part of an HTML or XML page is a type of node containing different kinds of data.

- **JavaScript** is a scripting language designed to interact with web pages and is made up of the following three distinct parts:

➤➤ ECMAScript, which is defined in ECMA-262 and provides the core functionality
➤➤ The Document Object Model (DOM), which provides methods and interfaces for working with the content of a web page
➤➤ The Browser Object Model (BOM), which provides methods and interfaces for interacting with the browser
