//? WITHOUT WORKERS:: This provides each page its own memory, event loop, DOM, and so on. E
//? Each page is more or less sandboxed and cannot interfere with other pages.
/*
*  USING WORKERS:::, browsers are able to allocate a second child environment that is totally separated from the original page environment.
? This child environment is prevented from interacting with single threadâ€“dependent constructs such as the DOM, but is otherwise free to execute code in parallel with the parent environment.
