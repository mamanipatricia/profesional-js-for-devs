<!-- Because of the way that inline scripts are parsed, the browser sees the string "</script>" as if it were the closing </script> tag

<script src="http://www.somewhere.com/afile.js"></script>
When the browser goes to resolve this resource, it will send a GET request to the path specified in the
src attribute to retrieve the resource—presumably a JavaScript file

The second option for turning this code into a valid XHTML version is to wrap the JavaScript code
in a CDATA section. In XHTML (and XML), CDATA sections are used to indicate areas of the docu-
ment that contain free-form text not intended to be parsed. This enables you to use any character,
including the less-than symbol, without incurring a syntax error

VAR, LET
The declaration redundancy errors are not a function of order, and are not affected if let is mixed
with var. The different keywords do not declare different types of variables—they just specify how
the variables exist inside the relevant scope.

Be aware there are a few cases where typeof seemingly returns a confusing but technically correct
value. Calling typeof null returns a value of "object", as the special value null is considered to be an empty object reference.

## , functions are considered objects

The typeof operator returns "undefined" when called on an uninitialized variable, but it also
returns "undefined" when called on an undeclared variable, which can be a bit confusing. 

The value undefined is falsy
